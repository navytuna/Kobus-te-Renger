*Personality:* Charles, as an Aspergian, is generally a loner. There are inherent exceptions to this rule of thumb, with people who are intellectuals being chief among them. [Other exceptions appear to be people with great skill, intelligence, or Honor (He adheres to the Sangheili code of honor that he found about after the war.)] Despite his wartime hatred for Sangheili, Charles has developed respect for members of the Swords of Sanghelios [Most likely cause for change in heart: Admirance of skill in combat and strategy.].
